## Description
The most fundamental web application of them all. The almighty To-Do-List. Stay organized and accomplish more by keeping track of your daily tasks. This is a full stack web application, utilizing Sequelize.js, Express.js, and Handlebars.js in conjunction to implement the Model-View-Controller paradigm retrospectively. Server-side sessions stored into the database for user login. HTTP requests executed with Axios. JawsDB Kitefin deployed as a Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) solution. Hosting done with Heroku.
